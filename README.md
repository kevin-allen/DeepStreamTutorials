# DeepStreamTutorials

DeepStreamTutorials contains a series of notebooks that explore how to run inference using the NVIDIA DeepStream SDK. 

DeepStream is working in the GStreamer framework. Here are a few advantages

* Optimize inference speed.
* No memory copies in the pipeline
* Avoid sending data back and forth between CPU and GPU memory.
* Application development can be done in Python, c++ and in Graph Composer
